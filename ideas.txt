Idle/clicker game app - some pixel thing to click, menu for upgrades, visual update the pixel getting clicked (hard), clicking animation

Tennis app where it uses accelarametor. Could do something insanely hard where you link your phone with a desktop app and then you can play tennis. Can you bluetooth wii remote to phone.

Still doing the Machine Learning guitar app (can tell what chords/notes you/a video are playing)
